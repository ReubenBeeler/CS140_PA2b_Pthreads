Q2.a List parallel code that uses at most two barrier calls inside the while loop


@Andras: Currently uses 3 barrier calls... should we redo part b after changing to 2 barrier calls? Also how do we only use 2?


Q2.b Report parallel time, speedup, and efficiency for  the upper triangular test matrix case when n=4096 and t=1024. 
Use 2 threads and 4  threads (1 thread per core) under blocking mapping, and block cyclic mapping with block size 1 and block size 16.    


@Andras: Look at file `output.txt`.



Please indicate if your evaluation is done on CSIL and if yes, list the uptime index of that CSIL machine.  

We used CSIL! The uptime was about 0.25 when testing. More uptime information before and after test cases can be seen in file `output.txt`.
